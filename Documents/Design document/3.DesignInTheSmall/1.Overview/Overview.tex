\section{Overview}
   The "Design in-the-small" chapter encompasses two main components: content design and presentation design.

   The content design section focuses on content tables that provide data specifications for different topics, types of topics, groups, or multiple groups. These data specifications are crucial for navigation and presentation design.
    
    In the presentation design aspect, each page is visually represented by a screenshot displaying the elements visible on the screen. All links within each page are clearly distinguishable as they are underlined and labeled with their respective types. Additionally, a brief description precedes the appearance of two images, explaining the purpose or function of the links.
