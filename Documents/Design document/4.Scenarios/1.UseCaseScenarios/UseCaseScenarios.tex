	\section{Use case scenarios}
		Use case scenarios help to focus on the needs of the users. They provide a way of understanding the user's behaviour and interaction with the application. This helps the designers create intuitive navigation structures according to the needs of the users, organize the web content and define the functional requirements of the website.
