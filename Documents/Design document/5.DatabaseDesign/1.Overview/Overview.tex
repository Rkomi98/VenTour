\section{Overview}
Database Design is made by a set of processes that streamline the creation, development, implementation, and maintenance of data management systems. It involves strategically designing the structure and organization of a database to meet specific requirements and optimize its functionality.

The primary goals of the database design is to generate conceptual and logical design models for the intended database system. 

Once the conceptual design is established, it leaves the floor to the logical design phase. This phase involves translating the conceptual model into a more detailed representation that can be implemented in a specific database management system. The logical design determines the data structures, defines the tables and relationships, and establishes the integrity rules with constraints.
