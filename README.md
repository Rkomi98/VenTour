## Project Description
In this repository you can find the design and the implementation of a website of a possible Venture Capital Company. As a VC, its goal is to show the areas of interest and the the companies in which the people of the VC invest. 

The requirements contain some constraints about the relationships of the main entities of the website. The project is divided into four main parts: Design, Backend, Frontend and Usability test.

### Architecture:
In this section we talk about the high-level structure and organization of the hypermedia application. It describes the major components and their relationships, providing an understanding of how different sections of the system work together to achieve the specific functionality.
    1. **System Components**: The repository is split in two main part: Backend and Frontend. We will better focus in the specific section. In Backend you can find the relational database and the package needed to run the application (see the section Backend for more information). In the folder ''Frontend'' there is everything that is due to the design and implementation of the website: it means we put all the HTML/CSS code used to see the pages, the VUE components and the function used to see some interactive tool developed in the website.
